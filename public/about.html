		<p>
		This webpage was designed and created by Andrew Dolge, Christian Linhardt, Zach Glasgow, and Issam Himmi. We are Computer Science students at the University of St. Thomas and this website was
		created for our Web Development class. The purpose of this project is to create a prototype for a possible class registration system replacement. This class registration system was built with
		Vue.js, and styling with Bootstrap, and a database powered by Sqlite3. Students or Faculty are able to register and login on our login page, and after logging in are redirected to our search
		system where students are able to register or waitlist for classes, with faculty being able to view the current roster for their classes. There is a brief video at the bottom of this page that
		will go through our application in more detail.
